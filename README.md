# XtxtUML

XtxtUML is a domain-specific language for executable UML modeling. It is part of the [txtUML project](https://github.com/ELTE-Soft/txtUML). This forked repository serves as a personal workplace, where I polish my contributions to XtxtUML as part of the finalization process of my BSc thesis.
